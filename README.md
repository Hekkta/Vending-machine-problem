# Vending-machine-problem

This is a problem that came up recently that I've been pondering in the back of my mind.

I found that brute forcing the solution is too time consuming, but I got some inspiriation from k-means clustering to create what I think is a nice solution.

Instead of trying each possible route that the technicians should take, we give a random route to all of them and then move the points individually depending on the total distances gained or lossed from the moving.
